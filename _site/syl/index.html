    <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course covers computational techniques in the context of designing, architecting, managing, and analyzing large-scale online experiments. Sample course topics include crowdsourcing, interface instrumentation, tidy data management, web architectures and devops, experiment monitoring and management, and best practices in quantitative/qualitative experiment analysis and reporting, including Bayesian multilevel regression. Bridging theory and practice, students will design and implement sample experiments throughout the course, including a course-long research project.</p>

<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

<p>After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critically evaluate and deconstruct experiments you encounter.</li>
  <li>Identify application areas for technologies such as instrumentation tools in experiment workflows.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the characteristics and structure of data you collect to refine experiment analysis options.</li>
  <li>Use algorithms, aggregation, sampling, and similar techniques to refine and manipulate data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>Assignments are the core of this course. Each assignment will focus on a particular aspect of the experiment pipeline, such as transformations and analysis of a collected dataset or criticism and design of existing experiments.</p>

<h2 id="readings--reflections">Readings + Reflections</h2>
<p>The readings are a critical part of the course. 
These include chapters in the textbook, research papers, and even blog posts.</p>

<p>To help reflect on the material, we have weekly written reflections.</p>

<p>Written reflections are a summary of papers and material you’ve read, either in the class or outside of it.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Your course grade comes from three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments (35%)</li>
  <li>Final Project (25%)</li>
  <li>Participation (15%)</li>
  <li>Reflections and Readings (25%)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, all work is to be done by yourself.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to discuss at length with your classmates about ideas and material in the course, in preparing for quizzes and assignments, in designing experiments and code nuances, and so on. However, all assignments, reflections, etc should be your own. Projects may encourage teamwork, that is, in that case you are expected to work closely with your partner/(s) to solve problems and prepare a common agreed-upon solution and implementation. (A word of advice: be sure you use git to commit, push, and merge work with your teammates often. In assessing team contributions, for example, the git history often shows individual contribution very clearly.)</p>

<p>Note in particular that copying of any material, may it be a single sentence or a figure, from any location (including the internet) without proper acknowledgment of the source constitutes plagiarism. If in doubt, please ask for clarification.</p>

<p>Any violation of the WPI’s guidelines for academic integrity will result in no credit for the assignment, potentially for the entire course, and requires referral to the Student Affairs Office for disciplinary action. More information on definitions, responsibilities and procedures regarding the WPI academic honesty policy can be found online.</p>

<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>

<p>You will be allowed a one time one day late turn-in without penalty, assuming you have a legitimate reason as discussed with the professor. All other late assignments will be penalized by subtracting 30% of the total achievable points, but only if turned in within the first 24 hours after the due date. Between 24 to 48 hours late will result in a reduction of 70% of the total achievable points. Late point reductions cannot be made up by later improvements of the assignment. Certain deliverables may not allow for any late days, such as project deliverables and presentations.</p>

<p>I would like you to be aware of the rationale behind late policies. For one, a late policy is a measure to ensure you stay on track and do not run into the problem of “snowballing” with your other responsibilities. At a higher level, late assignments place extra burden on both staff and your fellow classmates. Staff typically allocate time to grade assignments shortly after the due date. Late assignments break this and require staff to allocate extra sessions at the expense of their other responsibilities. This, in turn, places a burden on the entire class as grading must be complete before handing grades and critical feedback back to students.</p>

<p>For these reasons, please be considerate and turn your projects in on time. If something comes up, reach out early rather than later.</p>

<h2 id="useful-resources">Useful Resources</h2>

<p><strong>WPI Writing Center</strong> 
Located on the first floor of Daniels Hall (room 116), the Writing Center is a valuable resource for helping you improve as a writer. Writing Center tutors are your peers (other undergraduate and graduate students at WPI) who are experienced writers themselves and who enjoy helping others tackle thinking/writing challenges. Although a single tutoring session should never be seen as a quick fix for any writing difficulty, these sessions can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, and teach you strategies for organizing, revising, and editing your course papers, projects, and presentations. Writing Center services are free and open to all WPI students in all classes, and tutors will happily work with you at any stage of the writing process (early brainstorming, revising a rough draft, polishing sentences in a final draft). Visit the Writing Center website &lt;wpi.edu/+writing&gt; to make an appointment.</p>

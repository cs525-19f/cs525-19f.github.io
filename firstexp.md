title: First Experiment- Steps in Online Experimentation
permalink: /firstexp/
---

Crowdsourcing platforms are a key ingredient in the dish that is large scale online experimentation.

The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with these platforms, by designing and running an experiment.

You have been divided into two project teams: Team Prolific and Team Turk.
Your goal is to design a simple experiment for each of these platforms.

## General Requirements

- Aim to have two or more conditions in the experiment that you can analyze statistically/visually.
    - (Optional) It may be a good idea to assign a particular team member for this role.
    - (The book R for Data Science is a great starting point for plotting and basic data manipulation, and statistical comparisons are relatively easy in R.)
- Keep the experiment itself simple. You might consider replicating something that has known results, or create something that you are reasonably confident produce will lead to interesting results.

## Deliverable: Presentation/Report Documenting the Process

While your team is getting up to speed with your assigned platform (Turk or Prolific), take steps to document the experience.

Consider taking screenshots of key menus and features.

Any problems or confusing parts could also be documented.

The end goal of this activity will be to produce a Presentation (or Report/Handout) that your team will use to lead a discussion on the pitfalls and promises of your platform.

## Deliverable: Experiment Code, Data, and Analysis Docs

All experiment code, data, and analysis documents should be zipped and submitted as part of the final steps of this project.

In particular, ensure that your analysis docs include a PDF that has a description of the experiment, including motivation, methodology, results, and reflection/discussion of the results and what you learned.

Also, make sure to either a) host the experiment somewhere we can access for grading, or b) include instructions on how to run it.

## Key Dates
- Sep 25 - Class discussion of experiment ideas, official assignment release.
- Oct 2 - Checkin / "pilot" study week.
- Oct 9 - Final submission for grading.

## FAQs

Q: What sample size should we use?  
A: Keep it very small! We are not looking for statistical significance. However, we **do** want you to control sources of noise in your experiment-- everything from training to instructions to task design should be carefully considered. Basically, aim to make an experiment that could plausibly scale.
